                        <br/>
                        On this page you will have a brief overview of technologies used here! <br/>

                        Alright! Let's kick off with some of the basic concepts that brought this App together!

                        <h5>Dependency Injection</h5>
                        <p>
                            Spring Dependency Injection (used with <code>@Autowired</code> annotation) helps you inject
                            Spring component-objects in your app.
                            <br/>
                            A Spring component is any class that Spring has been adviced 'watch' by giving it an
                            annotation. Its a managed bean. Spring by defaults creates singletons when creating
                            autowiring
                        </p>

                        <h5>Inversion of Control</h5>
                        <p>
                            In short, IoC is a design pattern that allows the calling class/container to provide their
                            own dependency version. That is, if you DO NOT hardcode the instance of your dependency in
                            your components.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Back end Communication</h5>
                        <p>
                            I used <code>@Controller</code> with creates a RESTful API that calls the backend for
                            operations.
                        </p>

                        <hr/>

                        <h5>Now let's talk about technologies used</h5>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Bootstrap 3.7</li>
                            <li>Spring Boot Web</li>
                            <li>Spring Boot Security</li>
                            <li>Spring Boot JPA</li>
                            <li>Spring Thymeleaf</li>
                            <li>JQuery</li>
                            <li>maven</li>
                            <li>git</li>
                        </ol>


                        <p/>
                        <h3>
                            <bold>Now, let me take you through each of the above technologies</bold>
                        </h3>

                        <h5>Bootstrap 3.7</h5>
                        <p>
                            Bootstrap is a CSS framework that makes it easy and convenient to make-up and style-up your
                            application.<br/>
                            Developers get to focus on the meat of the project - building the business logic and the
                            securities around it - not the cosmetics of the application. Since we started using
                            Bootstrap, we stopped spending too much time in the mirrow :)
                        </p>

                        <h5>Spring Boot Web</h5>
                        <p>
                            JavaEE gives us an API to build web applications. Before SpringBoot-Web, we have to manually
                            configure the JEE application - defining the web.xml for directives, and going through all
                            the pain. Now, Spring-Web abstracts that away from the developer to help build efficient
                            WebApps faster and nicer :)
                            <br/>
                            Spring MVC is modeled also by this plugin. It helps resolve templates and manage business
                            session objects (Controller --> Browser --> Controller)
                        </p>
                        <h5>Spring Boot Security</h5>
                        <p>
                            It would all be useless to build an application that would be in the public domain without
                            securing it with the right weapons. Before The Spring guys built this tool, we used to write
                            web-sessions and managed them manually. Upon successful login , we would create a token for
                            a
                            session, and attach it to the HTTP session, and on each back-end request, we would manually
                            check in some hashtable if the session existed or was not expired.<br/>
                            Now Spring Security gives us a break from all the fault-prone setup. It takes away this
                            setup
                            routine, allowing for a quick application dev - once again!

                        </p>

                        <h5>Spring Boot JPA</h5>
                        <p>See, Spring always makes sure to respect the rules of Java, and just as always, they follow
                            the
                            JRS documents when creating these cool tools. JPA allows us to manage data flow between the
                            database
                            and the business logic.<br/>
                            You'd normally find it in what is commonly known as the <i>Data Layer</i> which sits between
                            the
                            business logic and the database. <br/>
                            We used to write all SQL/MySQl commands and queries and flying them through the JDBC. So,
                            some
                            generous guys built a tool called <strong>Hibernate</strong>, which was taking away the pain
                            of
                            having to write SQL statements which, you know, most Java Devs would do bad at, and making
                            sure
                            that
                            we focus on Java - what we do best.
                            <br/>
                            Then Spring guys took Hibernate a step further - they wrapped Hibernate (which wraps-in JDBC
                            by
                            the
                            way) within their tool (Spring JPA) aka Spring Data. Now Spring Data gives us basic CRUD
                            operations
                            without having to write a single line of code. Furthermore, if you have been a good-dev,
                            following
                            the JavaBeans standard, SpringData allows you to query your objects using CamelCasing in
                            your
                            interface repository method - making sure that you don't live another day to see SQL on your
                            screen.
                            You should be worried if you see yourself having to write queries within the SpringData
                            framework
                            (yes, they allow you to write your own SQL too - that is to give backward compatibility for
                            stinking-code hahaha)
                        </p>

                        <h5>Spring Thymeleaf</h5>
                        <p>Thymeleaf is just an enhanced version JSP. Just not as beautiful as Angular - just easier to
                            use
                            compared to JSP and JSF. But it actually
                            gives you a front-end display for your business data. This is where we bind business fields
                            and
                            object. It is really just a managed HTML
                        </p>

                        <h5>JQuery</h5>
                        <p>
                            I used this JQuery for messing around with the sidebar menu. After some coding, I realised
                            that
                            I did not really need it. So I reduced some code from it.
                            More JQuery was used by Bootstrap - our <i>Makeup Artist</i> to manipulate divs within the
                            page
                        </p>

                        <h5>Maven</h5>
                        <p>
                            This is our build tool. I could have used other built tools like Ant or gradle. I chose
                            maven
                            over Ant because Maven manages my dependencies well. And I did not choose gradle because I
                            have
                            not really played with it before, but I heard it is a better than maven. I just don't know
                            much
                            of it as yet!
                        </p>
                        <h5>Git</h5>
                        <p>
                            Version Control System. Git - code sharing.
                        </p>
